### _A Houdini shelf tool that automatically creates PBR materials for various renderers from the input textures._

## üìñ Table of Contents

## üîë Key-Features
* Quickly create PBR materials with just a few clicks from your input files!
* Supports any texture files that have the texture type written at the end of the file name and is sepparated by an underscore: `sample_texture_4k_displacement.exr`
* Easy copy-paste installation
* Support for different renderers: Right now you can choose between creating a **Karma** or **Mantra** PBR material.
* Preset oriented workflow: Every texture providing website has its own naming convention. Some call it albedo while others call it diffuse. This tool tries to streamline the process for the user of choosing add his own presets inside the variable `preset_data` (right at the top of the code) 
* Expandable setups:
* Custom naming conventions: Don‚Äôt want to mess with the code to add your own preset? Choose `Custom setup` inside the main menu to be prompted with a window where you can input your own naming conventions. (NOTE: Those setups won't get saved and you will have to input them for each new material)
* Smart context detection: If you already have a valid material network open, the tool won't ask the user for a path to create the material and will just take the active pane, saving a few clicks. 
* Use `CNTRL` or `SHIFT` or `ALT` or `CMD` + `CLICK` on the shelf tool to activate "Quick Setup", bypassing the main menu and saving 2+ clicks per material creation! 

## üìã Requirements
* Houdini license of **any** kind (Apprentice, Core, Indie, FX,... )
* Houdini 20.0.547+ (_may_ work with older versions but it's untested)
* Python 3 (comes preinstalled with Houdini)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1) Go to the [PBR-Express.py](PBR-Express.py) file
2) Copy the raw text (button on the top right)
3) Inside Houdini, go to any shelf tap and right click > `New Tool... `
4) Optional: Name your tool however you like
5) Optional: Pick a fitting icon
6) Under the tab `script` just paste the previously copied raw code
7) On the bottom right click `Apply` & `Accept`

## ü§î How does it work?

## ü§ù Contributing
### Adding missing presets 
* This is something everyone can do with minimal Python/scripting knowledge. Just follow the structure inside `preset_data` and add the name of your.... I dont have access to every single texture providing website and there are endless possibilities of naming variations. The more people contribute with websites and their naming convention, the better the tool will recognize the texture types.


## üîÆ Future Plans
with plans to expand the script to support materials for **Redshift**, **Arnold**, **Vray** and more.
