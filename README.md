## üîë Key-Features
<details>
<summary><strong> Quickly create PBR materials with just a few clicks! </strong></summary>
<br>
Input your texture set, select your preferred renderer and the path to your material library and voil√†! See "Manual" for more details on how to use the tool.
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> Easy copy-paste installation </strong></summary>
<br>
No need to download anything, just copy and paste the raw code from PBR-Express.py as a shelf tool. See "Installation"
<br><br>
</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong> Texture-naming flexibility </strong></summary>
<br>
Supports any texture sets that have the texture type written at the end of the file name and it is separated by an underscore: e.g. `sample_texture_4k_displacement.exr` OR `sample_texture_displacement_4k.exr`. See "How to use"
<br><br>
</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong> Support for different renderers </strong></summary>
<br>
The script is currently able to create materials for Karma (MTLX Surface Shader) and Mantra (Principled Shader). Nevertheless, its quite easy to add support for other render engines. See "Contributing" for more infos.
<br><br>
</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong> Bulk creation of materials </strong></summary>
<br>
See "Tips"
<br><br>
</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong> Unknown texture handling </strong></summary>
<br>
The script currently supports albedo(diffuse), ao, height(displacement), normal, roughness, metallic and alpha(opacity) maps. If the script does not recognize a certain type of texture, it will ask the user if the texture should be loaded into the material anyway or be forgotten.  
<br><br>
</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong> Preset-oriented workflow </strong></summary>
<br>
Every texture providing website has its own naming convention. Some call it albedo while others call it diffuse. This tool tries to streamline the process of differentiating between all of those naming conventions and having one central variable (`preset_data`) that is easily expandable and holds every website name (e.g. Quixel) with its corresponding naming convention (e.g. "Albedo", "AO", "Displacement", ...)
<br><br>
</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong> Expandable from the ground up </strong></summary>
<br>
The script was created with easy expansion in mind. Not only can presets be added easily, but adding new texture types is also reasonably straightforward and with a bit of Python knowledge even support for new render engines can be added without waiting for this repo to be updated. See "Contributing" for more infos.
<br><br>
</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong> Custom naming conventions </strong></summary>
<br>
Don‚Äôt want to mess with the code to add your own preset? Choose `Custom setup` inside the main menu to be prompted with a window where you can input your own naming conventions. See "How to use" for more infos.

## üìã Requirements
* Houdini license of **any** kind (Apprentice, Core, Indie, FX, ...)
* Houdini 20.0.590 (_may_ work with older versions, but it's untested.)
* Python 3 comes preinstalled with Houdini (may vary for Linux/Mac; check the [official documentation](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/hom/index.html#which-python))

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1) Go to the [PBR-Express.py](PBR-Express.py) file
2) Copy the raw text (button on the top right)
3) Inside Houdini, go to any shelf tab and right click > `New Tool... `
4) Optional: Name your tool however you like
5) Optional: Pick a fitting icon, I use `BUTTONS_chooser_folder` or `BUTTONS_chooser_image_color`
6) Under the tab `script`, just paste the previously copied raw code
7) On the bottom right, click `Apply` & `Accept`

## üìñ Manual
### How it works
The tool uses the data from these _three variables_ to match each input file to a known texture type and create the proper material setup for the renderer of choice.   

   `preset_data`: This variable holds the name of a texture providing website and the naming conventions that they are using for each *texture type*. The order of the naming convention should always stay the same (e.g. 1st: Albedo map, 2nd: AO map, ...). If a website does not provide a certain texture type, an empty placeholder (`""`) has to be inputed instead.   
   `supportedTextures_data`: This variable (at the start of the script still empty) holds all of the supported texture types in the exact order that they should come from `preset_data`. It will later be given values by the script based on what comes in from `preset_data` while removing duplicates.  
   `supported_renderers`: This is a simple list of all of the supported renderers.


### How to use
1. Press the shelf tool and you will be prompted with a file-chooser dialog where you can select your PBR textures.
2. Choose your preferred textures. The files have to **end** with the texture type OR have it written **after** the resolution; everything has to be separated by an **underscore**: e.g. `websiteName_4k_displacement.exr` or `sample_texture_displacement_4k.exr`.
   - Some examples of file names that won't work with the script as of now: `sample_texture_4k-color.exr` , `color_websiteName.exr`
   - DO NOT use any **semicolons that have a space before and after** them in your file paths. `C:/Desktop/my ; folder/texture.png` will break the script. Also, who names their folders like that?
3. The MAIN MENU will appear, where you will have 3 options:
   1. **Quick Setup:** The script looks through _all_ of the possible naming conventions from `preset_data` and tries to match your input files to one of the texture types. If there are two or multiple files that are of the same texture type, the script will throw an error. **This is the recommended setting for using the script.**  
   2. **Preset List:** The user will be prompted with a list of all of the presets. Upon selecting one, the script will compare the input files to _only_ the namings from the selected preset. This was the intended way of using the tool when it was first created.
   3. **Custom Preset:** The user will be prompted with a list of all of the supported texture types. The user can now input custom namings for all of the texture types. Those will be compared to the input files. Using this option makes sense if you have a one off naming convention for a texture set and don't want to mess with the script itself. Those new namings won't get saved and you will have to input them again for each new material using this convention. When wanting to use a custom naming convention multiple times, it is recommended that one types it into `preset_data`. See ["Adding missing presets"](#adding-missing-presets) for more informations.
4. Choose the preferred renderer. 
5. Choose the material library in which the material will be created.

### Tips
- Use `CTRL` on the shelf tool to activate "Quick Setup", bypassing the MAIN MENU and saving a few clicks per material creation.
- Use `CTRL` + `SHIFT` on the shelf tool to activate "Bulk Quick Setup". You can now input multiple texture sets. Just press "Accept" after each set and you will be prompted with the same window again. Upon pressing "Cancel", the materials will be created.
- If you already have a valid material network open, the tool won't ask for a path to a material library and will just take the active pane, saving a few clicks. (If there are multiple panes open, the tool will take the first one.)
- The script writes logs to the console for every major action it takes. In the case of troubleshooting, it might be worth having a look.
- For more troubleshooting, one could uncomment the function `debugMetadata()`, which is scattered all over the script, to get the metadata for each file printed to the console. This would be an example print: 

```
[DEBUG] Metadata of each selected file:
[DEBUG] Path: D:/Nextcloud/Textures/Bricks/1/TexturesCom_Bricks_Rh_2x2_1K_albedo.tif
[DEBUG] File Name: TexturesCom_Bricks_Rh_2x2_1K_albedo
[DEBUG] File Ending: albedo
[DEBUG] File Type: DIFFUSE
```



## ü§ù Contributing
### Foreword
This chapter serves as a guide for extending the script to meet your individual needs. Due to my other commitments, I won't be able to consistently add support for new renderers or texture types on a frequent basis. This is why I've designed the tool to be easily expandable, allowing anyone with some Python knowledge to incorporate support for their preferred texture providers or more niche texture types. If you choose to enhance the script in this manner, contributing to the GitHub repository would be highly valued, enabling everyone to benefit from open-source collaboration.


> _üö® Disclaimer üö®_ Just a heads up: this is my first attempt at a substantial script, and my programming knowledge is self-taught. While the tool does its job quite well, I can't promise that contributing will be a walk in the park. Things might not be as straightforward or intuitive; your patience and understanding are greatly appreciated!


### Adding missing presets 
This is something everyone can do with minimal Python or scripting knowledge. Just follow the already existing preset structure inside the variable `preset_data` and add your own presets. The order should always stay the same; just look at the other entries for guidance. Additionally, you can take a look at the next variable, `supportedTextures_data`, which uses the same order. If the website doesn't provide a certain texture type, for example, metallic textures, just leave an empty string `""` in the space where it would normally sit.

I don't have access to every single texture providing website (nor the patience to do so), and since every website has its own naming conventions, there seem to be endless possibilities for naming variations. The more people contribute with websites and their naming conventions, the better the tool will be at recognizing every file name from every website.

### Adding missing texture types
   1. Add the name of the texture type inside `supportedTextures_data`.
   2. A few lines below you would also need to add it in the for each loop `for key, values in preset_data.items():`, just follow the same structure as the texture types while using the next availible index number.
   3. Now you need to make the actual code for the node creation inside `def nodeCreation()`. Again it's best to look at how the other texture nodes are being created and connected to other nodes. The most important variables will be:
      - set_name: The name of the texture set, e.g. For a file named `myTextures_4k_normal.png`, the set_name would be `myTextures`.
      - goalNode: This is the network where the nodes will be created.
      - file_data: This is a variable that holds the data of each selected file. Things like the path to the file, the file name, the file extension and the recognized texture type. The data would first need to be unpacked, but again, it makes sense to look at how it has been done for the other renderers. I normally did it like this:
      ```
        for metadata in file_data:
            file, name, ending, textureType = metadata      
      ```

### Adding render engines
   1. Add the name of the new render engine to `supported_renderers`.
   2. Now you just have to handle the actual node creation inside `def nodeCreation()`. See step 3. above in [Adding missing texture types](#adding-missing-texture-types). The only difference being, that you will need to create the whole material from the ground up.


## üîÆ Future Plans
- Adding support for other render engines like Vray, Arnold, Redshift, ...
- Adding support for more texture types like ~~emission~~, translucency, sss, ...
- Adding support for more types of texture names (e.g. file names that are separated by `-`)
- ~~The option to create multiple sets of materials once the script is active~~
- Some intuitive solutions for dealing with color spaces
